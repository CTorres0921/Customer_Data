 Customer Satisfaction Data Analysis

📊 Overview
This project involves cleaning and analyzing customer survey data with a focus on understanding overall satisfaction ratings. The goal is to explore central tendency, variability, and distribution of customer feedback using statistical techniques and visualizations.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset, `CustomerData.csv`, includes the following relevant features:
- Age
- Overall Satisfaction Rating (primary focus)
- Other demographic or survey-related variables

🔍 Workflow and Methods

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Imported required libraries and loaded the dataset
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Computed mean, median, and mode for overall satisfaction
   - Explored distribution and central tendency metrics

3. **Statistical Visualization**
   - Used histograms, boxplots, and distribution plots to visualize satisfaction ratings
   - Investigated potential outliers and data spread

4. **Analysis Focus Shift**
   - Initially explored Age but shifted emphasis to Overall Satisfaction based on project goals

📈 Key Findings
- Central tendency measures provided a clear view of the average satisfaction level.
- Visualizations revealed the spread and skewness of satisfaction ratings.
- Findings offer insight into areas for potential customer experience improvement.
